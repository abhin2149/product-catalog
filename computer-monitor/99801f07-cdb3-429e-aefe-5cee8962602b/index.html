and collaborative classrooms. With high-performance in-cell touch technology, this 24” (23.8” viewable) Full HD display provides smooth and responsive touch tracking, along with amazing screen performance, within a sleek and bezel-less design. USB Type-C connectivity offers a single-cable plug-and-play solution for laptops, while DisplayPort output enables easy screen mirroring or extended desktops ideal for office productivity and podium touch applications such as conference rooms or classrooms. A magnetic stylus pen lets you write or draw on screen, and easily attaches to the display stand for secure storage. So whether used on its own on office desktops, as a presentation station in corporate meeting spaces, or as a front-of-classroom interactive teaching hub, the TD2455 helps to boost efficiency and productivity. *Some laptops may need to enter BIOS mode and change the power management setting to “tap-to-wake”. </div> </div> </div>     <div class="vs-container-fluid py-5 my-5 " id="featureLegacy"> <div class="row vs-container rc-feature"> <div class="col-lg-12"> <div class="vs-container-fluid" data-feature-id="4526" id="feature0"><div class="row vs-container rc-feature"><!-- 1 col: begin --><div class="col-lg-12 rc-content"><h2>Versatile Touch Applications</h2>Whether used as a check-in kiosk at reception, as a collaboration station with co-workers and colleagues at the office, or as a touch podium for front-facing teaching, this sleek and slim touch display seamlessly integrates into your workflow for boosted efficiency and productivity.<div class="row text-center"><div class="vs-callout"><strong>Agile yet Scalable Touch Display</strong></div></div><div class="row"><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="https://www.viewsonic.com/vsAssetFile/global/img/product-rc/_lcd_display_%28new%29/TD2455/TD2455-01-Any%20Touch_pc.jpg"></div></div><div class="col-lg-12 rc-content wow zoomIn"></div><!-- 1 col: end --></div></div><div class="vs-container-fluid" data-feature-id="4527" id="feature1"><div class="row vs-container rc-feature"><!-- 1 col: begin --><div class="col-lg-12 rc-content"><h2>Efficient Multitasking</h2>With advanced DisplayPort Multi-Stream technology and support for up to 4-screen daisy chaining*, this display can transform into the ultimate touch screen workstation – in mirror and extended modes – for increased productivity. *up to 4 with a PC; up to 3 with a laptop<div class="row text-center"><div class="vs-callout"><strong>DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport (MST)</strong></div></div><div class="row"><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="https://www.viewsonic.com/vsAssetFile/global/img/product-rc/_lcd_display_%28new%29/TD2455/TD2455-Daisy%20chain_pc.jpg"></div></div><div class="col-lg-12 rc-content wow zoomIn"></div><!-- 1 col: end --></div></div><div class="vs-container-fluid" data-feature-id="4528" id="feature2"><div class="row vs-container rc-feature"><!-- 1 col: begin --><div class="col-lg-12 rc-content"><h2>Touch Annotation for Presentations</h2>An included stylus pen easily attaches to the magnetic base of the display, and allows you to draw, write notes, or perform other detailed tasks that require more accuracy than your fingertips alone.
